# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis üìä  
This project analyzes electric vehicle sales and trends using Tableau and Excel for data cleaning.  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project aims to provide insights into the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in terms of growth trends, key manufacturers, and CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility. It combines **data cleaning** in Excel and **data visualization** in Tableau to transform raw data into meaningful business insights.

### Key Components  
- **Data Source:** Public dataset on electric vehicles  
- **Tools Used:**  
   - Excel for **data cleaning and preprocessing**  
   - Tableau for **data visualization and analysis**  
- **Objective:** Identify trends, top manufacturers, and the distribution of EVs across different states and years.  

## üîß Data Cleaning in Excel  
To ensure the dataset was ready for analysis, the following steps were taken in Excel:

1. **Removing Duplicates**  
   - Checked for duplicate rows using `Remove Duplicates` and ensured data uniqueness.

2. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Identified missing values in key columns and filled them with appropriate defaults or removed irrelevant rows.
   - For numerical columns, missing data was replaced using average values.

3. **Standardizing Columns**  
   - Renamed column headers to clear, standardized names.
   - Example: `model_year` -> `Model Year`.

4. **Correcting Data Types**  
   - Fixed incorrect data types for numerical and date columns (e.g., converting text to numbers, aligning date formats).

5. **Data Formatting**  
   - Cleaned extra spaces, standardized text casing, and ensured uniform formatting.

6. **Sorting and Filtering**  
   - Sorted the dataset by `Model Year` and `Total Vehicles` to identify trends.  
   - Filtered irrelevant or incomplete rows.

7. **Dataset Optimization**  
   - **Compression Techniques:** Saved the Excel file with optimized formats, like `.csv` for smaller file size.
   - **Splitting Large Data:** Divided the dataset into smaller, logical chunks (e.g., by year or state) to upload more manageable files to GitHub.
   - **File Size Checks:** Ensured that no single file exceeds GitHub‚Äôs size limit of 100MB. 

## üîç Key Insights  
The cleaned dataset was analyzed in Tableau to uncover the following insights:

1. **Total Vehicles:** 150,413 EVs analyzed.
2. **Top Manufacturer:** Tesla leads with **52.7%** market share.
3. **Growth Trend:** Significant growth observed in 2023 with **37.1K** EVs compared to **14.4K** in 2017.
4. **CAFV Eligibility:**
   - **Eligible Vehicles:** 41.6% of total EVs.
   - **Unknown Eligibility:** 46.3%, indicating a gap in eligibility information.

5. **State Distribution:** California has the highest number of EVs with **150,052** vehicles.
6. **Top Models:**
   - **Model Y** (Tesla) and **Model 3** (Tesla) are the most popular models.
